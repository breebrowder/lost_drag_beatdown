## THEME: LOST AND FOUND

This is a simple, interactive, and easy to use adventure game built entirely in Python. Tasked to us by Holberton School, we have created this interesting journey taken by a drag queen who just wants to have the most fabulous lashes in the room. Game is played entirely in the terminal by the user.
