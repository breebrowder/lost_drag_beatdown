## THEME: LOST AND FOUND

## Description

This is a simple, interactive, and easy to use adventure game built entirely in Python. Tasked to us by Holberton School, we have created this interesting journey taken by a drag queen who just wants to have the most fabulous lashes in the room. Game is played entirely in the terminal by the user.

Lost and Found Drag Beatdown is a text-based adventure game. You (yes, you!) are a drag queen getting ready for a performance. To slay at your performance, you'll have to make a lot of decisions. Each of your choices decides your fate!

Will you make it to the performance on time? Will you put together a winning performance? Will you make friends or enemies? And what about these lashes of yours? You have a bad habit of losing things...

## Installation

You want to play? It's easy! Just git clone into your local machine and execute.

```
git clone git@github.com:breezybrow/lost_drag_beatdown.git
./lost_drag_beatdown.py
```

## Usage

Playing is easy! Scenarios will be presented to you so you can fully immerse yourself in the storyline. Follow along with the prompts. Make sure to fully enter the answer you choose with no typos!

After prompting, you'll enter your answers. Some will end the game immediately! Others will make their effect known later. At a certain point, you'll start the feel the consequences...

## Examples

```
You will have many decisions to make today, some will determine your death, others will determine your success.
Ready to play? Type y or n.

Make your decision!
y

```
